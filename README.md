# Women in parliament

The visualization shows the proportion of seats held by women in Middle Eastern and North African parliaments. Hovering over a bar causes a tooltip containing additional information to be displayed.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and combines React and D3 to implement the bar chart. React renders the visualization components, whereas D3 handles data and axis calculations.

## Getting started
